# Text Transformer

A tiny web tool that lets you convert your text into *italic style* and also flips the casing for fun—like shouting in lowercase or whispering in caps.

---

## Features

- **Italic Converter** — Turns your plain input into italic-styled text.
- **Text Case Switcher** — 
  - If your input contains *any uppercase*, it gets converted to *all lowercase*.
  - If it's *all lowercase*, it flips into *ALL CAPS*.
- Responsive layout with vanilla HTML, CSS (under 50 lines!), and JavaScript.

## Try It Out

Just clone and open the `index.html` file in your browser. It’s all frontend, no server or setup needed.
